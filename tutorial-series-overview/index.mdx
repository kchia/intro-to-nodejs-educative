## Introduction

Welcome to the Introduction to Node.js tutorial series. This tutorial series consists of the following six parts:

- [Part I: Node.js Overview](/blog/introduction-to-node-js-part-i-node-js-overview)
- [Part II: The Node.js Application Programming Interface (API)](/blog/introduction-to-node-js-part-ii-the-node-js-api)
- [Part III: JavaScript Essentials Review](/blog/introduction-to-node-js-part-iii-javascript-essentials-review)
- [Part IV: Building a RESTful API with Express](/blog/introduction-to-node-js-part-iv-building-a-restful-api-with-express)
- [Part V: Authentication with Passport.js and JSON Web Tokens](/blog/introduction-to-node-js-part-v-authentication-with-passport-js-json-web-tokens)
- [Part VI: Building a Live Trivia Game with Socket.IO](/blog/introduction-to-node-js-part-vi-building-a-live-trivia-game-with-socket-io)

By the end of this tutorial series, you will be able to:

- Use Node.js to build server-side JavaScript applications
- Deepen your JavaScript knowledge to build better applications
- Build web applications with Express & Socket.io
- Use Node Package Manager (npm) to manage, build & publish packages

## Prerequisites

An intermediate-level of JavaScript knowledge is assumed. Note that this is **not** a tutorial for beginners.

## Installation Guide

To complete this tutorial series, you'll need to install Node.js (v14 or newer).

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is free, open-source, and available for all operating systems. You can install Node.js by either downloading the source code or installing it with Homebrew.

- **Downloading the Source Code:** Official packages for all the major platforms are available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Other package managers for Linux and Windows are listed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

- **Installing with Homebrew:** [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for macOS and Linux operating systems. On macOS, if you already have Homebrew installed, you can install Node.js very easily by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh

brew install node

```

For this course, make sure you're on version 14 or greater. You can check your Node.js version by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh

node --version

```

Every Node.js installation also comes with a package management tool, `npm`, which allows modules to be easily installed and offers version and dependency management of packages.

### Node Version Manager (nvm)

`nvm` is a popular way to run Node.js. This tool allows you to easily switch between Node.js versions, and install new versions to try out and easily rollback if needed.

## Installing Visual Studio Code (Optional)

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) offers a fantastic ecosystem of extensions and themes as well as debugging tools for Node.js. Like Node.js, it is free, open-source, and available for all operating systems. It is the recommended code editor for this tutorial series.

## Why Node.js?

Node.js is gaining popularity in the industry. As of August 2021, Node.js had [~80k stars on Github](https://github.com/nodejs/node). [Many big companies](https://youteam.io/blog/top-companies-that-used-node-js-in-production/) (e.g., Netflix, Uber, [Paypal](https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/node-js-at-paypal-4e2d1d08ce4f), Microsoft) are using Node.js. Node.js is a popular choice for building [microservice-oriented architectures](https://thenewstack.io/enterprises-embracing-microservices-node-js/).

Why use Node.js? Node.js is light, scalable, & fast. It uses a **_single-threaded_**, **_non-blocking I/O_** model capable of processing multiple concurrent requests using asychronous request handling. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms, as they will be explained in the tutorial.

Today, Node.js is supported by a large, active open-source community. [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) is the largest software registry in the world, hosting more than one million free, open-source packages. 11 million developers worldwide rely on NPM's publicly available and reusable modules.

Some of the most useful `npm` modules today include [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), which you will explore in this tutorial series.

## Review
